Since their inception, computers have quickly become the main channel of communicating information, and have established themselves firmly among traditional forms of media such as print and film.
Computer-based media allows for the creation of a vast range of interactive experiences, yet a lot of the ways in which we communicate information through computers still emulates traditional forms of media such as print.
My thesis explores the genre of interactive documents, a form of computer-based media that interweaves text and executable code. Interactive documents are designed to provide rich and engaging documents that take full advantage of their computational environment.

While interactive documents can often be very compelling ways to educate and to communicate complex information, they are only occasionally seen in practice.
The thesis explores ways in which we can simplify the authoring experience of interactive documents.
I propose and evaluate the usage of MDX, a Markdown extension that allows for writing JavaScript and JSX within Markdown, as a framework for authoring interactive documents and develop a number of examples as part of my practice.

<!-- I evaluate technologies and produce a number of practical outputs demonstating typical concepts in the creation of interactive documents. Lastly, the thesis contains a critical evaluation of the used technologies and an outlook of the type of medium for the future. -->

<!-- ### Concept

Interactive documents are a form of media that interweaves text and executable code.

- react to the user
- encourage the act of active reading
- create textual forms that are beyond the possibilites of linear text. -->

### Practice

My practical output features three articles that each examplify an aspect of interactive documents. Each of these examples are found online, and the reader is welcome to visit and explore them for yourself!
